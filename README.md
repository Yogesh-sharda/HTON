DEAR SIR/MADAM,
I Sounil Mandal along with my team(CB57) is working on the problem CBP20 which is Self Detecting Mental Health Status.
To tackle this problem we thought of to act as if we were a startup company which will have certain ficilities including(self detection of one's mental health).
We jotted down our work plan where we made a dummy website although a lot of work needs to be done so we are sending the stuff which is good so far.
Our next hurdle will be to detect one's health status as well as a chatbot(if possible).
Our team is divided its workplan into designing,develpment and testing.
